# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-06-14

## Status

Completed

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records,
as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

The templates can be adapted to include other relevant headers
(e.g. 'Alternative Solutions Considered'),
but each document should contain the headers used in this ADR.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
For a lightweight ADR toolset,
see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
