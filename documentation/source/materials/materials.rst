materials
=========

Bluemira materials are defined in a way that is intended to be flexible while allowing
material properties to be used and accessed by the code. This is achieved by providing
a small number of material classes and allowing specific materials to be represented
by dynamic configuration. It leverages functionality provided by `matproplib`
