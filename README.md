# Bluemira

![image](documentation/source/bluemira_intro_mosaic.png)


``Bluemira`` is an integrated inter-disciplinary design tool for future fusion reactors. It
incorporates several modules, some of which rely on other codes, to carry out a range of
typical conceptual fusion reactor design activities.

``Bluemira`` was created from two similar codes: ``BLUEPRINT`` and ``MIRA`` (see
[publications](#publications)).

## Work in Progress!

The `bluemira` team has been working hard since mid-2021 to combine ``BLUEPRINT`` and ``MIRA`` into a single reactor design framework. We took the opportunity to embark upon
a significant refactor of both code bases, delivering improved functionality, code
quality, and hopefully maintainability. This, along with some resourcing issues has
caused our feature roadmap to slip. A lot of functionality that was present in  ``BLUEPRINT`` and ``MIRA`` is not yet available in `bluemira`.

`Bluemira` is very much under active development, and will likely be subject to API
changes in the near future. We apologise in advance for these. Please do get in touch
before starting to use any modules, so we can warn you of changes to come.

Below is an overview of our development roadmap for 2023/24:

## Modules

``Bluemira`` is composed of various modules:

* `balance_of_plant`: power balance solver and tools
* `base`: the software backbone of the ``bluemira`` framework
* `codes`: interfaces to external codes (both API and file PI)
* `display`: plotting and display module
* `equilibria`: equilibrium solvers and objects
* `fuel_cycle`: fuel cycle model
* `geometry`: the geometry "engine" of the ``bluemira`` framework
* `magnetostatics`: magnetostatics solvers
* `materials`: materials module
* `plasma_physics`: 0-D plasma physics tools
* `radiation_transport` **[WIP]**: radiation and advection transport solvers
* `structural`: beam finite element structural solver
* `utilities`: collection of utility toolboxes for file IO, databases,
  machine learning, and misc.

## Publications

The ``bluemira`` code and its modules are described in the following publications:

* TBD

As ``bluemira`` is the result of an integration between two historical codes,
some previous publications may also be of interest.

## Code of conduct

See [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Installation

See our [installation guide](https://bluemira.readthedocs.io/en/develop/installation.html).

## Developing

For working on ``bluemira`` you will also need to install the development dependencies
and the git pre-commit hook:

```shell
python -m pip install --no-cache-dir  -e .'[dev]'
pre-commit install -f
```

Please see the [guidelines for contributing to bluemira](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Tests are run with `pytest`. To run the main tests:

```shell
pytest
```

To run all the tests:

```shell
pytest --reactor --longrun --plotting-on
```

`pytest` also supports running individual test files and selecting tests by name or
using a regular expression. See the
[pytest documentation](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/usage.html).

After a test run an html report of the results can be found in `report.html`. A test
coverage report can be found in the `htmlcov` directory.

## Building Documentation

The documentation is built with Sphinx. In addition the API documentation is created by
`sphinx-apidoc`.

To build the html documentation execute this command:
```shell
sphinx-build documentation/source documentation/build
```

New pages can be added by adding them to the `documentation/source` directory and adding
a link in the `toctree` section of `index.rst`.  The index page lives at
`documentation/build/index.html`. API documentation will be automatically generated from
the ``bluemira`` source code.
