    -------
    TBR
        Achieved by (n,Xt) reaction, which counts the number of tritium-producing
        nuclear reactions per neutron emitted at the source.

        We used the (n,Xt) score because the Lithium produces a maximum of 1 Tritium per
        reaction, so there won't be any concerns about uncer-counting the TBR.

    Powers
        Measures the nuclear heating in various locations and materials, and interpret
        this as power. "damage-energy" is given by eV per source neutron.
        Multiply by neutron source rate, and then divide by (number of atoms and
        threshold displacement energy) to get the DPA.

    Fluence
        Measures # of neutrons streaming through.
        "flux" is given in # per source particle, so multiply by # of source neutrons to
        get the total fluence over the simulation.
        Divide by area to get fluence in unit: cm^-2.
