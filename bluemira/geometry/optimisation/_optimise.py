    Minimise the given objective function for a geometry parameterisation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geom:
        The geometry to optimise the parameters of. The existing
        parameterisation is used as the initial guess in the
        optimisation.
    f_objective:
        The objective function to minimise. Must take as an argument a
        ``GeometryParameterisation`` and return a ``float``.
    df_objective:
        The derivative of the objective function, by default ``None``.
        If not given, an approximation of the derivative is made using
        the 'central differences' method.
        This argument is ignored if a non-gradient based algorithm is
        used.
    keep_out_zones:
        An iterable of keep-out zones: closed wires that the geometry
        must not intersect.
        Each item can be given as a :class:`.KeepOutZone`, or a
        dictionary with keys the same as the properties of the
        `:class:`.KeepOutZone` class, or just a :class:`.BluemiraWire`.
    algorithm:
        The optimisation algorithm to use, by default :obj:`.Algorithm.SLSQP`.
    opt_conditions:
        The stopping conditions for the optimiser. Supported conditions
        are:

            * ftol_abs: float
            * ftol_rel: float
            * xtol_abs: float
            * xtol_rel: float
            * max_eval: int
            * max_time: float
            * stop_val: float

        (default: {"max_eval": 2000})
    opt_parameters:
        The algorithm-specific optimisation parameters.
    eq_constraints:
        The equality constraints for the optimiser.
        A dict with keys:

        * f_constraint: the constraint function.
        * tolerance: the tolerances in each constraint dimension.
        * df_constraint (optional): the derivative of the constraint
            function. If not given, a numerical approximation of the
            gradient is made (if a gradient is required).

        The constraint is a vector-valued, non-linear, equality
        constraint of the form :math:`f_{c}(g) = 0`.

        The constraint function should have the form
        :math:`f(g) \rightarrow y`, where:

            * :math:`g` is a geometry parameterisation.
            * :math:`y` is a numpy array containing the values of the
              constraint at :math:`g`, with size :math:`m`, where
              :math:`m` is the dimensionality of the constraint.


        The tolerance array must have the same dimensionality as the
        constraint.

        The gradient function should have the same form as the
        constraint function, however its output should have size
        :math:`n \times m` where, again, :math:`m` is the dimensionality
        of the constraint and :math:`n` is the number of parameters in
        the geometry parameterisation.

        Equality constraints are only supported by algorithms:

            * SLSQP
            * COBYLA
            * ISRES

    ineq_constraints:
        The geometric inequality constraints for the optimiser.
        This argument has the same form as the ``eq_constraint``
        argument, but each constraint is of the form
        :math:`f_{c}(g) \le 0`.

        Inequality constraints are only supported by algorithms:

            * SLSQP
            * COBYLA
            * ISRES

    keep_history:
        Whether or not to record the history of the optimisation
        parameters at each iteration. Note that this can significantly
        impact the performance of the optimisation.
        (default: ``False``)
    check_constraints:
        Whether to check all constraints have been satisfied at the end
        of the optimisation, and warn if they have not. Note that, if
        this is set to False, the result's ``constraints_satisfied``
        attribute will be set to ``None``.
    check_constraints_warn:
        Whether to print a warning that constraints have not been
        satisfied at the end of an optimisation. This argument has no
        effect if ``check_constraints`` is ``False``.

    Returns
    -------
    The result of the optimisation.
