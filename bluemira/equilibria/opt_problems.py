OptimisationProblems for coilset design.

New optimisation schemes for the coilset can be provided by subclassing
from CoilsetOP, which is an abstract base class for OptimisationProblems
that use a coilset as their parameterisation object.

Subclasses must provide an optimise() method that returns an optimised
coilset according to a given optimisation objective function.
As the exact form of the state vector that is optimised is often
specific to each objective function, each subclass of CoilsetOP is
generally also specific to a given objective function, since
the method used to map the coilset object to the state vector
(and additional required arguments) will generally differ in each case.
