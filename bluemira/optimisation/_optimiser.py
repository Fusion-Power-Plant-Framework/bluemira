        Add an equality constraint to the optimiser.

        The constraint is a vector-valued, non-linear, equality
        constraint of the form :math:`f_{c}(x) = 0`.

        The constraint function should have the form
        :math:`f(x) \rightarrow y`, where:

            * :math:`x` is a numpy array of the optimisation parameters.
            * :math:`y` is a numpy array containing the values of the
              constraint at :math:`x`, with size :math:`m`, where
              :math:`m` is the dimensionality of the constraint.

        Parameters
        ----------
        f_constraint:
            The constraint function, with form as described above.
        tolerance:
            The tolerances for each optimisation parameter.
        df_constraint:
            The gradient of the constraint function. This should have
            the same form as the constraint function, however its output
            array should have dimensions :math:`m \times n` where
            :math`m` is the dimensionality of the constraint, and
            :math:`n` is the number of optimisation parameters.
