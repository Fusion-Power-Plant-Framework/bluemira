class PanellingDesigner(Designer[np.ndarray]):
    r"""
    Design the shape for panels of the first wall.

    The panel design's objective is to minimise the cumulative panel
    length (minimising the amount of material required), whilst
    constraining the maximum angle of rotation between adjacent panels,
    and the minimum length of a panel.

    A best first guess will be made for the number of panels and their
    positions and then an optimiser will be run to minimise the
    cumulative length of the panels, whilst satisfying the minimum length
    and maximum angle constraints.

    Sometimes the initial guess will not enable the optimiser to find a
    solution that satisfies the constraints. In these cases an extra
    panel is added and the optimiser run again, until the constraints
    are satisfied, or the number of panels added exceeds the
    ``n_panel_increment_attempts`` build config parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    params:
        The parameters for the panelling design problem. See
        :class:`.PanellingDesignerParams` for the required parameters.
    wall_boundary:
        The boundary of the first wall to build the panels around. Note
        that this designer constructs panels around the *outside* of the
        given wall boundary; i.e., the panels enclose the wall.
    build_config:
        Configuration options for the designer:

        * algorithm: str
            The optimisation algorithm to use (default: ``'SLSQP'``\).
        * opt_conditions: Dict[str, Union[float, int]]
            The stopping conditions for the optimiser
            (default: ``{"max_eval": 400, "ftol_rel": 1e-4}``\).
        * n_panel_increment_attempts: int
            The number of times to try incrementing the number of panels
            in order to satisfy the given constraints (default: 3).
        * boundary_discretisation: int
            The number of points to discretise the input boundary wire
            into. A higher number here increases the fidelity in the
            interpolation used in the :class:`.Paneller`, and can prevent
            overlaps in the panels and boundary.
