# This tutorial finds a Spherical Tokamak (ST) equilibrium in a

# using a constrained optimisation method with bound constraints on
# the maximum coil currents and some additional constraints.

# ## Introduction

# In this example, we will outline how to specify a `CoilsetOptimisationProblem`
# that specifies how an 'optimised' coilset state is found during the Free Boundary
# Equilibrium solve step.

# ## The `CoilsetOptimisationProblem` class

# The `CoilsetOptimisationProblem` class is intended to be the abstract
# base class for coilset optimisation problems across Bluemira.
#
#
# The goal of the `CoilsetOptimisationProblem` is to be able to return
# an optimised coilset, judged according to the provided objective,
# subject to the set of constraints, using a numerical search algorithm
# subject to optimiser conditions and optimiser parameters.
#
# Subclasses of `CoilsetOptimisationProblem` thus should provide an
# `optimise()` method that returns the `CoilsetOptimiserResult`,
# containing the coilset optimised according to a specific objective
# function for that subclass.
#
# ### Ingredients for a Coilset optimisation problem
# - **Coilset**: the set of coils we want to optimise
#   - the coilset 'state' will be representated by an array
#   - **coilset_state**: state vector representing degrees of
#       freedom of the coilset
# - **Objective Function**: the function we wish to minimise.
#
#   - in bluemira, `ObjectiveFunction` is the base class for objective
#   functions.
#
# - **Constraints**: optimisation constraints that need to be satisfied.
#
#   - in bluemira, `UpdateableConstraint` is the abstract base mixin class
#   that is updateable.

# - **Optimisation algorithm**: the numerical algorithm used to optimise the
#   coilset state array.
#   - Usually based on NLOpt.
#   - There are several optimisation algorithms that can be used within
#     Bluemira.
#     Including gradient and non-gradient based.
#       - SLSQP
#       - COBYLA
#       - SBPLX
#
#     See the :py:class:`~bluemira.optimisation._algorithm.Algorithm`
#     enum for a reliably up-to-date list.
#   - Apart from the algorithm itself, you may also specify
#       - **optimisation conditions**: The stopping conditions for the optimiser.
#       - **optimisation parameters**: The algorithm-specific optimisation
#       parameters.
#
# # Example: Tikhonov Current COP
# `TikhonovCurrentCOP` is a `CoilsetOptimisationProblem` for coil currents
# subject to maximum current bounds with/without constraints that must be
# satisfied during the coilset optimisation.
#
# ## Parameters
#
# - **coilset**: `CoilSet` to optimise.
#
# - **eq**: `Equilibrium` object used to update magnetic field targets.
#
# - **targets**: Set of magnetic field targets to use in objective function.
#
# - **gamma**: Tikhonov regularisation parameter in units of [A⁻¹].
#
# - **opt_algorithm**, **opt_conditions** and **opt_parameters**
#
# - **max_currents**: Maximum allowed current for each independent coil
# current in coilset [A].
#
# - **constraints**: Optional list of `UpdatableConstraint` objects
#
# ## Coilset
#
# We first define the `CoilSet` to be optimised in our OptimisationProblem.
#
# We will consider the coilset to have positional symmetry about z=0, hence
# the use of SymmetricCircuit class.

# ## Optimisation Algorithm, Conditions and Parameters
#
# We next define the Optimiser: the optimiser algorithm, conditions and
# parameters to be used. There is no one-size-fits-all approach here,
# as the best optimiser for a given problem will depend strongly on the
# optimisation objective and constraints (if any) being applied in the
# problem.
#
# `Optimiser` is currently only a wrapper for NLOpt based optimisers, and as
# such, the range of algorithms that may be chosen is determined by those
# available in the NLOpt library. Not all algorithms will work for all
# objectives - some require gradient information, for example - and
# some require additional parameters. Check the NLOpt API documentation
# for more details.
#
# Care must also be taken to ensure the termination criteria for the
# optimisation are suitable. Otherwise, the optimisation may never
# stop running if tolerances are too tight, or may stop early and
# return poorly optimised states if the maximum number of evaluations
# is too low or tolerances are too large.
#
# **We will directly input the optimisation algorithm, conditions and**
# **parameters when defining the `TikhonovCurrentCOP`**
# %%
# %% [markdown]

# ## Iterators

# The `CoilsetOptimisationProblem` is only used to optimise the coilset state
# at fixed plasma psi;
# the Grad-Shafranov equation for the plasma is not guaranteed to still be
# satisfied
# after the coilset state is optimised.
#
# Picard iteration is therefore used to find a self-consistent solution,
# employed
# by `Iterator` objects. `PicardCoilsetIterator` specifies a scheme in which a
# Grad-Shafranov iteration is used to update the plasma psi alternate with
# Coilset
# optimisation at fixed plasma psi until the psi converges for the `Equilbrium`.
#
# ## Unconstrained Optimisation
#
# However, a poor initial `Equilibrium` (with corresponding `coilset`) will
# lead
# to difficulties during the Picard iteration used to find a self-consistent
# solution.
# It is therefore useful to perform a coarser fast pre-optimisation to try
# find a
# self-consistent state within the basin of convergence of the
# full constrained `OptimisationProblem`.

# We next define the list of `UpdateableConstraint` to apply.
#
# **Coil Field Constraints** are inequality constraints on the poloidal
# field at the middle of the inside edge of the coils, where the field
# is usually highest.
#
# A **Field Null Constraint** forces the poloidal field at a point to be zero.
#
# An `IsofluxConstraint` forces the flux at a set of points to be equal.
