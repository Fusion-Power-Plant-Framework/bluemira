Equilibrium and coilset optimisation - developer tutorial

#
# # Equilibrium and Coilset Optimisation
# Here we explore how to optimise equilibria, coil currents, and coil positions.
#
# This is an in-depth example, intended for developers and people familiar with plasma
# equilibrium problems, walking you through many of the objects, approaches,
# and optimisation problems that are often used when designing plasma equilibria and
# poloidal field coils.
#
# There are many ways of optimising equilibria, and this example shows just one
# relatively crude approach. The choice of constraints, optimisation algorithms, and even
# the sequence of operations has a big influence on the outcome. It is a bit of a dark
# art, and over time you will hopefully find an approach that works for your problem.
#
# Heavily constraining the plasma shape as we do here is not particularly robust, or
# even philosophically "right". It's however a common approach and comes in useful when
# one wants to optimise coil positions without affecting the plasma too much.

# Coil position optimisation
#
# Now, say that we want to optimise the positions the PF coils, and the currents of the
# entire CoilSet for two different snapshots in a pulse. These snapshots are typically
# the start of flat-top (SOF) and end of flat-top (EOF) as they represent the most
# challenging conditions for the coils and plasma shape.
#
# Here we set the flux at the desired LCFS to be 50 V.s and -150 V.s for the SOF and EOF,
# respectively. In this example, this is an arbitrary decision. In reality, this would
# relate to the desired pulse duration for a given machine.
#
# We're going to optimise the positions for an objective function that takes the maximum
# objective function value of two current sub-optimisation problems.
#
# This is what we refer to as a `nested` optimisation, in other words that the
# positions and the currents (in two different situations) are being optimised
# separately.
#
# First we specify the sub-optimisation problems (objective functions and constraints).
# Then we specify the position optimisation problem for a single current sub-optimisation
# problem.

# We set up a position mapping of the regions in which we would like the PF coils
# to be. The positions themselves are bounded by the specification of the
# `RegionInterpolator`s.
#
# Finally, we specify our position optimisation problem, in this case with the two
# previously defined current sub-optimisation problems (but we could specify more if we
# wanted to).
#
# Typically the currents can be varied linearly from the SOF to the EOF, so there isn't
# really much point in doing more than two different equilibria here from an optimisation
# perspective.
#
# Note that there are no constraints here, and if we wanted to add some they would have
# to pertain to the position vector in some form.
#
# For each set of positions, we treat the plasma contribution as being "frozen" and
# optimise the coil currents (with the various constraints). This works as for relatively
# good starting guesses (converged equilibria) the plasma contribution to the various
# constraints does not change much when the equilibrium is subsequently converged.
#
# For the sake of brevity, we set the maximum number of iterations for the position
# optimisation to 50. This is unlikely to find the best solution given our specified
# coil regions, but demonstrates the principle with acceptable run-times.
